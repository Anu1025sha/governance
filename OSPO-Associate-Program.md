# 👩‍🏫 TODO OSPO Associate Program (Organizations)

The OSPO Associate is a program within TODO that seeks to foster collaboration among communities dedicated to advancing the OSPO movement, with the aim to collaborate with TODO to enrich the OSPO resources, tools and services infrastructure (e.g cloud native adoption, security standards) and offer better assistance to OSPO within sectors (e.g automotive, software, retail, etc), and core responsibilities (e.g strategy, compliance, governance and community)

Entities opt to participate in the OSPO Associate Program for various reasons, which include:

* Enhancing their brand value by showcasing their commitment to open source efforts that contribute to the OSPO movement.
* Demonstrating their support for the mission and community of TODO.
* Highlighting their active collaboration with TODO in the development and enhancement of OSPO-related resources and tools.


## ✍️ Who can request to be an OSPO Associate?

As an OSPO Associate, your organization prioritizes OSPO-related topics. While an OSPO Associate may not necessarily have its own OSPO, the goal is to collaborate with TODO in order to enhance OSPO adoption and education, as well as contribute to the development of resources and initiatives.

Entities eligible to apply for the OSPO Associate program include:

* Open Source Communities and Projects
* Academia
* Governments
* Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs)
* Non-profit Organizations (NPOs)

Please note that the OSPO Associates program is not designed for service providers. Individuals are welcome to join the community and access our resources while adhering to TODO's code of conduct.

> Note: if your organization (e.g academia, goverment, NGO) has a formal and recognized open source startegy, center of exellence around open source or Open Source Program Office (OSPO), please consider [supporting and sponsoring TODO as General Member](https://todogroup.org/members/) to be entitled to general member benefits.

Being promoted as an `OSPO Associate`, means that your organization is committed to collaborate with other peers to enrich the OSPO resources, tools and services infrastructure and offer better assistance to OSPO.
