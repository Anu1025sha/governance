# TODO Touchpoint Meetings Framework

## üéØ Purpose

"Touchpoints" meetings serve as a vendor-neutral space to discuss challenges and opportunities 
for Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). It follows Chatham House Rules for privacy and openness. The goal is to integrate OSPO operations into broader organizational strategies, enhancing their recognition and success.


The TODO Group hosts two Touchpoints every month, with content being cross-shared between both sessions. Conversations are governed under Chatham House Rules:

* TODO General Member and OSPOlogy Touchpoints Europe (Thursdays)
* TODO General Member Touchpoints (Fridays)
